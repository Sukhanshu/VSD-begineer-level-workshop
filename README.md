# Beginner Physical design using open-source EDA Tools
## Contents:
1. Study and review various components of RISC-V based picoSoC
2. Chip planning strategies and introduction to foundry library cells
3. Design and characterize one library cell using Magic Layout tool and ngspice
4. Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree
5. Final steps for RTL2GDS

### The open source tools that are involved in this workshop are as follows

Yosys – for Synthesis, 
Graywolf – for Placement, 
Qrouter – for Routing, 
Netgen – for LVS, 
Magic – for Layout and Floorplanning, 
Qflow – RTL2GDS integration, 
OpenSTA & Opentimer -Pre-layout and Post-layout Static timing analysis
